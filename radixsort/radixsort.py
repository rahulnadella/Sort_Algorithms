"""
Radix sort is an algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits.
n numbers consisting of k digits each are sorted in O(n Â· k) time. Radix sort
can process digits of each number either starting from the least significant
digit (LSD) or starting from the most significant digit (MSD). The LSD algorithm
first sorts the list by the least significant digit while preserving their
relative order using a stable sort. Then it sorts them by the next digit, and so
on from the least significant to the most significant, ending up with a sorted
list. While the LSD radix sort requires the use of a stable sort, the MSD radix
sort algorithm does not (unless stable sorting is desired). In-place MSD radix
sort is not stable. It is common for the counting sort algorithm to be used
internally by the radix sort. A hybrid sorting approach, such as using insertion
sort for small bins improves performance of radix sort significantly.

Worst Case: O(wn)
Worst Space Complexity: O(w + k)
